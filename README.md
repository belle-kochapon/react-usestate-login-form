# React Login Form Example

This project demonstrates a fundamental React implementation of a simple login form. It showcases how to manage user input for username and password using React's `useState` hook and how to respond to input changes using `onChange` event handlers. The form submission is handled by an `onSubmit` event handler that logs the captured username and password to the console.

## Key Concepts Illustrated

- **`useState` Hook:** Declaring and managing state variables (`username` and `password`) to hold form input values.
- **`onChange` Event Handling:** Updating the state variables in response to changes in the input fields.
- **`onSubmit` Event Handling:** Handling the form submission event, preventing default browser behavior.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-usestate-login-form
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
5.  **View in your browser:** Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by your development server (typically `http://localhost:5173` for Vite or `http://localhost:3000` for Create React App).

This example provides a basic foundation for handling form input in React applications.
